⚙️ How It Works

Core Components
1-Player Input:
The player selects the number of questions, difficulty level, and operation type.
The player answers math questions, which vary based on difficulty and operation type.

2-Question Generation:
Random Numbers: Each question consists of two numbers chosen randomly within specific ranges based on the difficulty.
Operations: The program can generate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or random combinations.

3-Answer Checking:
After the player answers, the program checks the correctness of the answer.
Results are displayed immediately with color feedback (Green for correct, Red for wrong).

4-Scoring and Summary:
The total number of correct and wrong answers are tracked.
The player’s result is displayed as either "PASS" or "FAIL" based on the number of correct answers.
